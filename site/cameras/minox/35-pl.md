The Minox 35 PL is an ultra-compact 35mm camera prioritizing portability. It features a sharp, collapsible 35mm f/2.8 Color-Minotar lens. It offers programmed automatic exposure, controlled by a built-in CdS light meter. The viewfinder displays over/underexposure warnings. Focusing is manual, using a distance scale on the lens barrel. Its incredibly small size and light weight make it ideal for travel and discreet photography. It requires batteries for its electronic shutter and light meter. Despite its simplicity, it can deliver surprisingly good image quality.
