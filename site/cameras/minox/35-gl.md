The Minox 35 GL is an ultra-compact 35mm camera prioritizing portability. It features a sharp, collapsible 35mm f/2.8 Color-Minotar lens. It offers aperture-priority automatic exposure, controlled by a built-in CdS light meter. The viewfinder displays the selected aperture. Focusing is manual, using a distance scale on the lens barrel. Its small size and light weight make it ideal for travel and discreet photography. It requires batteries for its electronic shutter and light meter. Despite its simplicity, it can produce excellent results.
