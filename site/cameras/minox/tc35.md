The Minox TC35 is a remarkably compact 35mm zone-focus camera. It features a sharp 35mm f/2.8 Color-Minotar lens. Exposure is controlled automatically via its built-in light meter, with an aperture-priority mode. The viewfinder displays aperture settings and over/underexposure warnings. Its small size makes it highly portable. It requires batteries for its electronic shutter and light meter. The TC35 is designed for discreet street photography and everyday snapshots where portability is paramount.
