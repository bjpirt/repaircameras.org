The Bronica ETR is a modular 6x4.5 medium format SLR system known for its versatility and affordability. It features interchangeable film backs (allowing mid-roll changes), lenses, and viewfinders (including waist-level and prism options). The ETR offers aperture-priority automatic exposure and manual control. Its leaf shutter lenses synchronize flash at all speeds. It typically uses 120 or 220 roll film, producing 15 or 30 exposures per roll respectively. Its compact size for a medium format camera makes it relatively portable.
