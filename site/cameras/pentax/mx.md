The Pentax MX, introduced in 1976, is a compact yet robust, fully mechanical 35mm SLR designed for professionals. Smaller and lighter than the KX, it offers a bright viewfinder displaying both shutter speed and aperture. Key features include interchangeable focusing screens, depth-of-field preview, and optional motor drive or winder compatibility. Its mechanical shutter operates from 1s to 1/1000s plus Bulb, needing batteries only for the light meter.
