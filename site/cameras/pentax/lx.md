It offers both aperture-priority automatic and manual exposure modes, with an exceptionally sensitive off-the-film (OTF) metering system for accurate readings even during long exposures. The LX boasts a durable, weather-sealed body and a hybrid electro-mechanical shutter with speeds up to 1/2000s. Key features include interchangeable viewfinders and focusing screens, mirror lock-up, depth-of-field preview, and compatibility with motor drives. Its Pentax K mount accepts a wide range of lenses.
