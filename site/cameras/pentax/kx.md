The Pentax KX, launched in 1975, is a fully mechanical 35mm SLR and a more advanced sibling to the K1000. It retains the K1000's robust build and manual operation but adds several features. These include a self-timer, depth-of-field preview, and mirror lock-up for critical shooting. Notably, the KX displays both the selected shutter speed and aperture within its bright viewfinder, offering more comprehensive shooting information compared to the K1000's match-needle system. Its K mount provides compatibility with a wide array of lenses.
