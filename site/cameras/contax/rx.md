The Contax RX, a 35mm SLR introduced in 1994, blends manual focus with advanced features. Its standout is the digital focus indicator in the bright viewfinder, aiding precise manual focusing. It offers various auto-exposure modes (aperture-priority, shutter-priority, program) alongside manual control. The RX boasts a robust build, a fast 1/4000s shutter, and TTL flash control. Its Contax/Yashica mount accepts excellent Carl Zeiss lenses. A unique depth-of-field indicator further assists photographers. Though manual focus, the RX provides modern aids for a refined shooting experience.
