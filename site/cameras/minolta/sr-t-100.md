The Minolta SR-T 100 is a solid, fully mechanical 35mm SLR. It provides straightforward manual exposure control with shutter speeds from 1s to 1/500s, plus Bulb. Unlike the SR-T 101 and 303, it lacks Minolta's CLC metering system, instead using a simpler center-weighted meter. The viewfinder aids in focusing. It accepts Minolta SR mount lenses. The SR-T 100 offers a more basic, yet dependable, introduction to manual film photography.
