The Minolta A2, a 35mm rangefinder from the late 1950s, builds upon the original Minolta A. It features a bright, coupled rangefinder integrated into the viewfinder for accurate focusing. It's equipped with a sharp, fixed 45mm f/2.8 Rokkor lens. The A2 offers manual exposure control with a good range of shutter speeds and aperture settings. A significant addition is a built-in, uncoupled selenium light meter on the top plate. Known for its solid build and excellent lens, the A2 provides a classic manual rangefinder experience with integrated light metering.
