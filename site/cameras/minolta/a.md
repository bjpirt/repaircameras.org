The Minolta A was the first of a series of 35mm rangefinder cameras from the 1950s. Features included a coupled rangefinder for accurate focusing, bright viewfinder, and a fixed, high-quality Rokkor lens. They typically offered manual exposure control with a range of shutter speeds and aperture settings. The cameras were known for their solid build quality and sharp lenses, providing a classic rangefinder shooting experience.
