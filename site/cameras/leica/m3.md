The Leica M3, introduced in 1954, revolutionized rangefinder design. It features a bright, high-magnification viewfinder with parallax-corrected frame lines for 50, 90, and 135mm lenses. Its bayonet lens mount allows for quick lens changes. The M3 has a coupled rangefinder for precise focusing and a smooth, quiet cloth focal-plane shutter with speeds from 1s to 1/1000s plus Bulb. It lacks a built-in light meter, emphasizing its focus on manual control and precision. The M3 is celebrated for its build quality and exceptional user experience.
