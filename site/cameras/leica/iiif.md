The Leica iiif, a classic 35mm rangefinder, built upon its predecessors with the addition of a built-in flash synchronizer, a significant advancement for its time. It features a coupled rangefinder integrated into the viewfinder. The camera utilizes a reliable cloth focal-plane shutter with speeds from 1s to 1/500s, plus slow speeds accessible via a separate dial. It employs the Leica screw mount (M39), accepting a wide range of lenses. Compact and robust, the IIIf is a fully manual camera prized for its precision and historical significance.
