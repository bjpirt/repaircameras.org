The Chinon CP-5 is a sophisticated 35mm SLR offering versatile shooting modes. It features Programmed AE (with two variations for fast or slow subjects), Aperture-Priority AE, and full Manual control. A notable feature is its Twin Program mode, optimizing aperture and shutter speed for different action. It has a bright viewfinder with LED indicators for shutter speed and exposure information. The CP-5 uses the Pentax K mount and can accept optional autofocus lenses and a power winder for added functionality. It also includes a self-timer and multiple exposure capability.
