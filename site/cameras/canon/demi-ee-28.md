The Canon Demi EE 28 is a compact half-frame camera, meaning it takes two vertical photos on a standard 35mm frame, effectively doubling the number of shots per roll. It features a fixed 28mm f/2.8 lens. Exposure is fully automatic, controlled by a built-in selenium light meter, requiring no batteries. The viewfinder is bright and clear. It offers zone focusing with distance icons. Its small size and automatic operation make it a convenient and economical camera for casual shooting.
