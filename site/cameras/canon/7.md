The Canon 7, a 35mm rangefinder camera from 1961, boasts a Leica M39 screw mount and a unique external bayonet for the fast 50mm f/0.95 lens. It features a built-in uncoupled selenium light meter with high/low sensitivity settings. The bright viewfinder offers selectable frame lines for 35, 50, 85/100, and 135mm lenses with parallax correction. It has a metal focal-plane shutter with speeds from 1s to 1/1000s plus Bulb, and a self-timer. A notable feature is the film rewind indicator.
