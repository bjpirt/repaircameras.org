title: About This Site
---

This site exists to preserve the valuable knowledge on how to repair cameras so that they can be kept operational long into the future.

All of the code running it is open source and all of the content (that's written for the site) is released under an open license. The scanned documents belong to the authors of the original document (i.e. the camera manufacturers). A big thanks goes to all of those in the camera community who scanned these in and shared them with the world.

Hopefully it will remain a useful resource for camera enthusiasts long into the future.

This site will remain free and open to the public.
