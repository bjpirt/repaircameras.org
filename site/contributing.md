All contributions are welcome, especially if you've found some service manuals that can help others fix their cameras.

You can contribute via a Github Pull Request, alternatively if you create an issue on the Github repository with the file or link you've found someone else can add it to the site if you're not comfortable coding. An easier way of accepting community contributions will be coming.

Contributions can take the form of:

- Scans of service manuals
- Scans of user manuals
- Links to Youtube videos
- Links to tutorials on the internet
