This site is built with openness in mind:

- The code running this site is all licensed under a permissive open source license.
- Any content created for this site (descriptions, etc) is all licensed under the GFDL license
- Any documents remain the property of the originator of the content of the document (e.g. a scanned Pentax service manual remains the property of Pentax)

The openness goes both ways, there is open access to the information on the site as well as an openness to adding more information from the camera community to it.

The site is created for the community, byy the community.
